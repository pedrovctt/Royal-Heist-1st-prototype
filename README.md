# Royal Heist (prototype)

This is a very simple 2D game I'm working on while learning programming. It's a basic game where
at the moment you can only explore one of the superior floors, controlling the main character Queen
using the arrows keys and the antagonist Thief using WASD, their names will be set in future updates.
The game is entirely made with Java and I'm using a library called **JPlay** to develop it. 
Although the library is not so well known, it's very simple for game development and helps me improve my skills.

[Download JPlay (only v2.0 and v2.1 available)] http://www2.ic.uff.br/jplay/jplay_download.html or you can just download
it directly from the repository on /lib/JPlay.jar

## Tech info

2. Set up your project with JPlay in your IDE.
